            mostly send or mostly receive and countries that have a similar amount of donations they receive and send?</p>

            c) Are there
            countries that change their role over time? That is, they used to mostly send donations and turn into mostly receiving
            donations and vice-versa?

                d) Are there countries in which you can find a sudden increase ("peak") or a sudden decrease
                ("valley")?
