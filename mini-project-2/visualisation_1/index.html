            <p>a) How does the amount donated vs. amount received change over time across all countries?</p> 
            <p>b) Are there countries that
            mostly send or mostly receive and countries that have a similar amount of donations they receive and send?</p> 
            <p>
            c) Are there
            countries that change their role over time? That is, they used to mostly send donations and turn into mostly receiving
            donations and vice-versa?; d) Are there countries in which you can find a sudden increase ("peak") or a sudden decrease
            ("valley")?
